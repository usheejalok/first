	A slideshow component for cycling through elements—images or slides of text—like a 	carousel.
      
	
	How it works
	
	The carousel is a slideshow for cycling through a series of content, built with CSS 	3D transforms and a bit of JavaScript. It works with a series of images, text, or 	custom markup. It also includes support for previous/next controls and indicators.

Step2:	Slides only
	Here’s a carousel with slides only. Note the presence of the .d-block and .w-100 on 	carousel images to prevent browser default image alignment.

	<div class="carousel-inner">
          <div class="carousel-item active">
            <img class="d-block w-100" "image path " alt="First slide">
          </div>
